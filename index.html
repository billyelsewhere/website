			<h1>We're from Elsewhere</h1>
			<h2>We’re a small, close-knit studio of design, strategy and tech people. We work with you to explore and understand the complex problems in your world, then we help you build the things that make your life simple again.</h2>

			<h4>Embracing complexity</h4>
			<h3>We live in a world filled with interesting challenges</h3>
			<p>Everyone has their own thing going on. Sometimes that brings it’s own flavour of problems that need solving. Knowing what to do, where to start, how to progress (not to mention where digital fits in) is tough.</p>
			<p>The way we work launches us and you headlong into your complexities. We take the time to map out and explore all the ins and outs and make sense of it.</p>

		<section id="getting-going">
			<h4>Getting going</h4>
			<h3>We think big, but start (really) small.</h3>
			<p>Once we have a map of an entire situation, we make a plan around the smartest, most pragmatic first step forwards. It means starting out as reduced and clutter-free as possible. Literally just the bits we need to teach us something will do.</p>

		<section id="iterating">
			<h4>Iterating and tweaking</h4>
			<h3>We welcome change and expect to adapt.</h3>
			<p>We design, build and ship things in small doses, testing in a controlled environment, and learning as we go.</p>
			<p>As we move forward, we keep checking back to where we need to be and update the plan with what we learn accordingly.</p>

		<section id="cocreating-educating">
			<h4>Co creating and educating</h4>
			<h3>We teach you the tricks of the trade</h3>
			<p>We think what we do works best when your entire company wants to change, so it makes sense to start with the people at the top.</p>
			<p>Regardless of this, we’ll structure our work so that your team work alongside us and get involved as much as they can. That way over time you can learn to do things yourself or hire the right people in.</p>
			<p>It’s more sustainable that way.</p>

		<section id="for-good">
			<h4>Doing our bit for good</h4>
			<h3>We work for all the right reasons</h3>
			<p>Our focus is working on projects with a purpose of doing good in the world. We've structured our business on keeping our overheads low and our cost-modelling fair.</p>
			<p>We will always strive to prioritise work which supports the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

			<h3>We would love to hear from you</h3>
			<p>Drop us a line so we can get together and understand your world in more detail..From there we can grab a coffee and have a chat, to see if there’s something we can help with.</p>
