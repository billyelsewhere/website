					<h1>Get help from Elsewhere</h1>
					<p>We’re a close knit studio of well-versed design, strategy and tech people.</p>
					<p>Websites, apps and platforms are what we do best, but we never start there. We work with you to explore and understand the complex challenges you and your organisation face, then we help you build all the things that feel great to use and make your life simple again.</p>
					<p>And we have fun doing it.</p>

				<h3>Embracing complexity</h4>
				<h2>If your problem was easy, you would have solved it yourself</h3>
				<p>To create something that makes sense and is really enjoyable to use, means fully appreciating the underlying complexity of the problem it solves.</p>
				<p>Knowing where to start can be daunting for a lot of organisations, particularly when it comes to digital.</p>
				<p>We always start by working with you to figure out and understand this complexity. We take the time to map it out and explore everything.</p>
				<p>We put people first because they can often be the most complicated part.</p>

				<h3>Getting going</h4>
				<h2>Always think big, just start (really) small.</h3>
				<p>Once you've helped us to understand your situation and we've mapped it out together, we make a plan around the smartest, most pragmatic first step forwards. It means starting out as clutter-free as possible.</p>
				<p>The plan gives us a direction to go in, although the truth is we know this plan will change once we start and learn more.</p>

				<h3>Iterating and tweaking</h4>
				<h2>Change is what makes it the best it can be.</h3>
				<p>We design, build and ship things in small doses, testing in a controlled environment, and learning as we go.</p>
				<p>As we move forward, we keep checking back to where we need to be and update the plan with what we learn.</p>

				<h3>Co-creating and educating</h4>
				<h2>You will learn with us</h3>
				<p>The work we do makes the most sense when an entire company adopts the same approach and mindset, so it makes sense to always work with decision makers close to the top.</p>
				<p>Our way of working means your team is part of everything we do and is involved as much as they can be day to day. That way over time you can learn to do everything yourself or hire the right people in.</p>
				<p>It’s more sustainable that way.</p>
